# Purpose 

This is a Substrate Plan document designed to be used as part of the Substrate project to help people create and discuss different ways to run cities, states, or countries.

The primary tool for interface with these Plans will be AI combined with web and other UIs. AI will be used because it will give us the ability to hold all the various pieces in context at once, and understand them, analyze them, compare them, and then discuss as humans.

These plans include many components that all work together using the Telos style of defining context, such as Problems, Mission, Goals, Challenges, Strategies, Solutions, Metrics, Projects, Budgets, and more. 

In addition to those core pieces, Plans can also include things like Beliefs—or Models—which are ways that this particular author sees the world, which is likely to shape the Plan in particular ways.

The goal of the whole exercise is to TRANSPARENTLY present a cohesive plan for how to run a given entity, whether that's a team, or a department, or a government of whatever size. All the various components can reference each other, either explicitly or implicitly, and using AI we can visualize how they all fit together into the overall plan.

# SCOPE

This is a Plan for how to run the United States of America.

# CHALLENGES // the biggest problems facing the US according to the author

1. A lack of a positive shared identity for the country, meaning we're not agreeing that there's anything worth fighting for or sacrificing for
2. Lack of social cohesion which is causing us to be unable to accomplish anything
3. Short political cycles that encourage short-term thinking and solutions

# MISSION

1. Unify the United States of America around a positive shared identity based on the Bill of Rights

# STRATEGIES

1. A positive and transparent set of propaganda campaigns designed to produce unity in the country. Includes top actors and athletes talking about multiple issues: how it's ok to disagree, how external groups are doing their best to divide us, how you have to think for yourself, how it's possible to hold multiple ideas your mind at once even when they seem contradictory, etc. Basically these campaigns work like the Saturday morning cartoons of old, where we were entertained and also taught lessons, and we collectively improve our critical thinking skills through these high quality and continuous messaging.
2. A new set of subjects and courses for all schools that teach Bill of Rights concepts, but more importantly, how the world works in terms of physical laws, evolution, economics, etc. History is covered extensively, showing the positives and negatives of various types of government, etc. This is taught in a YouTube style format, but using real teachers combined with YouTube, AI, etc. The primary goal and focus for this education is to train people how to think broadly and independently. The value of faith is taught. The value of respecting different ways of living. The value of different points of view. And the focus on common goals.
3. For both the education and the propaganda campaigns, we focus on Ideal World, namely, how our ideal world differs from Europe's, or Canada's, or Iran's, or Russia's. We explicitly talk about it in our identity. We encourage people to be proud of it. We stress that we weren't there in the past, and we aren't there yet, but we're working towards it.

# IDEAL WORLD

1. People live in harmony with each other, with concepts like race, gender, and religion being extremely secondary
2. People are not oppressed by a government or religion
3. Society provides extraordinary support to every new person, giving them the education and resources to help them become the absolute best version of themselves
4. People can believe many different things, and pursue flourishing in vastly different ways, but they don't allow those beliefs to override the central goal of maximizing flourishing for everyone 
5. Society is largely based around art, exploration, and sharing of positive experiences—not on maximizing wealth or power
